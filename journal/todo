   X Verify ephemeris ingest
   X Verify ephemeris interpolation
   X Create client method to populate and order on the interp line for a given time period.
   X Need to update orders to planned after inserting to the plan table
   X Find planned events by querying for unplanned orders and using strip_id to correlate
   X Update order status to planned when finished planning?
   X Issue when hitting collection-orders no ephem

   X Update build ecef events to order fulfilled and remove from plan table
   X Should build or maybe replan also check for orders with state 1?

   / Verify distance calculator
   / Verify ona calculator
   / Update Rev info
   • Check Top when slamming with 10+ orders to see if what bottle neck may be
   • Status / Health managers
   • IMS update data for each ECEF
   • Use CPLQuery service

   • Issues:
      ◦ Planning in umbra? ECEFIMAGE collect times in ASC and DESC nodes
      ◦ Where to get file_id and rev_numbers?
         ▸ Ask the Mikes?

   • Timers
      ◦ Ephemeris timer daily
      ◦ Build timer - based on umbra trigger?
      ◦ Direct timer option?

   • Low Priority
      ◦ How to calculate image duration? is it the same as scan duration?
      ◦ Encrypt key part of the order? if so how do we then look it up prior to wbpbk?

• CG
   X CPL Query Service

• TMS
   • Status stuff
   • Revoked stuff
   • TEL mapping inserts on tel post

• General
   • Refactor unit tests to load all ENVs needed not from Eureka/Config service.
